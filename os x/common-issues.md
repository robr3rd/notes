Common Issues (OS X)
====================
Things I run into somewhat often.

Three-finger drag/selection no longer working
---------------------------------------------
For some reason this setting gets lost every so often.

`Preferences` > `Accessibility` > `Mouse & Trackpad` > `Trackpad Options...` > `Enable dragging` > `three-finger drag`
