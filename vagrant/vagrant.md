# Vagrant
## Vagrantfile Syntax Highlighting for PhpStorm
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/textmate/ruby.tmbundle
2. In PhpStorm's Settings, open the `TextMate Bundles` category.
3. Add (`+`) and select the directory of the cloned repository.
4. At the bottom of the `TextMate Bundles` settings, there is a table with two columns: `IDE Color Scheme | TextMate Color Scheme`. Make sure to select the appropriate match for your theme; otherwise (especially if you use a dark theme), you may end up with your nice, dark `IDE Color Scheme` being ruined by a stark white/default-colored `Color Scheme` in your code editor pane.
