# Notes
Just a set of personal notes for future reference.

Some of these may be for things that I would like to try out at some point, while others (probably most) will be notes or scripts that I've jotted down for things that I've already had to figure out.

I've slowly accumulated a sizable collection of such things on local machines over the years, but much of it has now been deprecated by newer software, and has been annoying to sync between systems. As such, I'm starting from scratch and hosting it remotely.

It is not guaranteed that all of this information will work for you at the time of reading it -- only that it *for me* it worked *when* it was written.
